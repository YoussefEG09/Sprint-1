# Java Object-Oriented Programming Exercises

This project contains several Java exercises focused on object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, static blocks, and more.

- [2. Phone and Smartphone Classes](#2-phone-and-smartphone-classes)
- [3. Static Blocks and Initialization](#3-static-blocks-and-initialization)

## 1. Car Class

### ✔️ Objective:
Create a `Car` class with attributes using `static`, `final`, and `static final`, demonstrating their differences. Also, implement `brake()` and `accelerate()` methods.

### 📂 Files:
- `Car.java`
- `Main.java`

### 💡 What it demonstrates:
- Differences between class-level and instance-level attributes.
- Use of static vs non-static methods.
- Initialization within the constructor.

## 2. Phone and Smartphone Classes

### ✔️ Objective:
Simulate a smartphone using inheritance (`Phone`) and interfaces (`Camera`, `Watch`).

### 📂 Files:
- `Phone.java`
- `Camera.java`
- `Watch.java`
- `Smartphone.java`
- `Main.java`

### 💡 What it demonstrates:
- Class inheritance.
- Implementation of multiple interfaces.
- Polymorphism through methods like `call()`, `photograph()`, and `alarm()`.
